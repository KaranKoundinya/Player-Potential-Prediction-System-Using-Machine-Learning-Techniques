# Player-Potential-Prediction-System-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

Aim of the Thesis: This thesis aims to harness the power of data and machine learning to 
predict the potential of football players using the FIFA dataset. Among five predictive models, 
the best-performing model is selected, and data analysis is conducted to uncover essential 
performance indicators and data relationships.
The Five data models selected are Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector 
Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression and Random Forest regression
Among the five predictive models examined, the Random Forest Regression model emerged 
as the best performer with an impressive R-squared value of 0.967, indicating an excellent fit 
to the data. It demonstrates a remarkable ability to capture complex relationships between 
player attributes and future potential. Its low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.68 and Mean 
Squared Error (MSE) of 1.23 underscore its precision in predicting player ratings
The questions which are used to create the KPIâ€™s and establish the relationship between the 
data are
Question 1: Player BMI and Physical Attributes
Question 2: Continental Comparison of Physical Attributes
Question 3: Relationship between International Reputation and Player Attributes
Question 4: Relationship between Age and Player Attributes
Question 5: Future Value Prediction and Club/Country Analysis
The model, equipped with newly created metrics, showcases meaningful patterns and data 
relationships, providing valuable insights into the factors driving player potential. The 
synthesis of data analysis and KPIs facilitates data-driven decision-making for player 
development and team management in professional football, offering quantifiable evidence 
of performance and the potential for future success
